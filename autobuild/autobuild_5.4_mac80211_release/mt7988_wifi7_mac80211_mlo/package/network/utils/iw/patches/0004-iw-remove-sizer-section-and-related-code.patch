Subject: [PATCH 04/13] iw: remove sizer section and related code

With commit 338059ace9d0 ("iw: change __cmd section scheme to fit
gcc/clang"), the __cmd section only includes pointers to struct cmd
rather than the struct itself. This means that the code to measure the
spacing is not needed anymore and can be dropped.

- * Unfortunately, I don't know how densely the linker packs the struct cmd.

- * We used to calculate this by taking the (abs value of) the difference

- * stops working because the entries of the "__cmd" section get rearranged
- * freely by the compiler/linker.
- *
- * Fix this by using yet another "__sizer" section that only contains these
- * two entries - then the (abs value of) the difference between them will
- * be how they get packed and that can be used to iterate the __cmd section
- * as well.
