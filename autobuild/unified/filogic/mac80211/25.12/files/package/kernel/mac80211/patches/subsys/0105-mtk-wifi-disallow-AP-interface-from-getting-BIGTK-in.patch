Subject: [PATCH 105/128] mtk: wifi: disallow AP interface from getting BIGTK
 in RX path

The problem was that when the AP interface with BIGTK set received
beacons with MMIE from other BSSes, it tried to verify the MIC using its
BIGTK, which must fail and be notified to the upper layer by
cfg80211_rx_unprot_mlme_mgmt().

The solution is to prevent the AP interface from getting BIGTK in
the RX path, as the AP should only use the BIGTK to calculate the
beacon's MIC value.
