Subject: [PATCH 039/236] mtk: hostapd: add extension IE list for non-inherit
 IE in mbssid

Certain clients do not scan all non tx profiles due to absence of
element ID extension list which is mandatory field in non inheritance
IE. Non inheritance Element ID is followed by extension element ID.
Length is expected to be mentioned. Currently we do not support any
extension element and hence filling length as 0.
